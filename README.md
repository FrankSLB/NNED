# NNED
Neural event extraction

This is a version of baseline (Using purely Bi-lstm to encode sentence, then do trigger classification.)
Could yield 66% f1 on liqi data. 58% on qin data. 70% on feng data.

Note: Could not yield 73% by adding cnn feature on feng data. Maybe needs tuning or code-checking.
